/**
 * JointGraphWrapper wraps jointGraph to provide:
 *  - getters of the properties (to hide the methods that could alther the jointGraph directly)
 *  - event streams of JointGraph in RxJS Observables (instead of the callback functions to fit our use of RxJS)
 *
 * JointJS Graph only contains information related the UI, such as:
 *  - position of operator elements
 *  - events of a cell (operator or link) being dragging around
 *  - events of adding/deleting a link on the UI,
 *      this doesn't necessarily corresponds to adding/deleting a link logically on the graph
 *      because the link might not connect to a target operator while user is dragging the link
 *
 * If an external module needs to access more properties of JointJS graph,
 *  or to make changes **irrelevant** to the graph data structure, but related direcly to the UI,
 *  (such as changing the color of an operator), more methods can be added in this class.
 *
 * For an overview of the services in WorkflowGraphModule, see workflow-graph-design.md
